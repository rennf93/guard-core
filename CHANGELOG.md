v1.0.0 (2026-03-25)
--------------------

### Added

- Complete synchronous API (`guard_core.sync`) generated via `scripts/unasync.py`, including sync versions of all 17 security checks, handlers, decorators, protocols, detection engine, and utilities
- `scripts/unasync.py` transformation tool converting async code to sync (`async def` to `def`, `await` removed, `aiohttp` to `requests`, `redis.asyncio` to `redis`, `asyncio.Lock` to `threading.Lock`)
- Sync protocols: `SyncGuardRequest`, `SyncGuardMiddlewareProtocol`, and sync versions of all handler protocols
- PEP 561 type stub markers (`guard_core/py.typed`, `guard_core/sync/py.typed`)
- Project governance files: `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`
- `README.md` with project documentation, badges, and ecosystem overview
- `.safety-project.ini` for dependency vulnerability scanning
- `MANIFEST.in` and `.gitattributes` for packaging
- `.python-version` specifying supported Python versions (3.10-3.14)
- Comprehensive edge-case test suites for cloud provider, HTTPS enforcement, IP security, rate limiting, and time window checks
- `docs/llms.txt` for LLM-assisted development context
- Complete sync test suite (`tests/test_sync/`) mirroring the async test structure

### Changed

- Restructured and consolidated the entire test suite into organized directories (`test_agent/`, `test_core/`, `test_decorators/`, `test_features/`, `test_handlers/`, etc.)
- Enhanced `CloudManager` with IP range change logging and improved provider refresh logic
- Updated `SusPatternsManager` with additional detection logic
- Enhanced `BehavioralProcessor`, `ErrorResponseFactory`, and `RouteConfigResolver` internals
- Minor updates to `IPInfoManager` handler
- Updated `BaseSecurityDecorator` route config handling
- Added mypy override for `guard_core.sync.*` (type suppression for generated sync code)
- Documentation fully standardized and verified for accuracy against source code
- Disabled safety pre-commit hook temporarily

### Fixed

- Suspicious pattern handling in `detect_penetration_attempt`

v0.1.0 (2026-03-23)
--------------------

### New Features (v0.1.0)

- **Initial release**: Guard Core extracted as a framework-agnostic security library for Python web applications.
- **Protocol-based architecture**: Uses `GuardRequest` and `GuardResponse` protocols for framework independence.
- **Full feature parity**: All security features available through framework-agnostic APIs.
- **IP Management**: Whitelisting, blacklisting, geolocation, cloud provider blocking.
- **Rate Limiting**: Sliding window algorithm with in-memory and Redis backends.
- **Penetration Detection**: Enhanced detection engine with pattern matching, semantic analysis, and performance monitoring.
- **Security Decorators**: Route-level security controls for access control, authentication, rate limiting, behavioral analysis, content filtering, and advanced features.
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive HTTP security header management following OWASP best practices.
- **Redis Integration**: Distributed state management for multi-instance deployments.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Usage monitoring, return pattern detection, and frequency analysis.
