    SecurityEvent/SecurityMetric are validated per request and EventBatch
    re-validates every buffered event on each flush, so an instrumented host
    app would otherwise emit a span per security event — hundreds of
    thousands a day under real traffic. plugin_settings is only read while
    building a model's validator, hence the forced rebuild.

    Idempotent: every guard-core path that can end up constructing one of
    these models calls this on its way there, so it may run once per
    SecurityConfig construction in a test suite. The applied flag is only
    set once all three models are confirmed muted (or guard-agent is
    confirmed absent), so a partial rebuild failure leaves it unset and the
    next call retries all three rather than silently leaving some of them
    permanently unmuted.
