class BoundedResponseBodyReader(Protocol):
    """Optional capability: read a size-capped prefix of the response body.

    WHAT: lets a caller read at most ``max_bytes`` of the response body
    without buffering the rest, and without disrupting delivery of the full
    body to the client afterward.
    WHEN: consulted by behavioral ``return_pattern`` rules (``json:``,
    ``regex:``, bare-substring) when ``SecurityConfig.behavior_scan_response_body``
    is enabled, so the response can be pattern-matched up to a bound instead
    of forcing the whole body into memory or being silently skipped. Unlike
    the request side, the eager ``GuardResponse.body`` accessor is not a safe
    fallback here: adapters may implement it as a property that raises for a
    response whose body is not yet fully materialized (a streaming response
    in particular), and that raise is indistinguishable from "no body" to a
    caller that cannot see inside the property. This capability is the only
    sanctioned way to read response body bytes for pattern matching.
    HOW: adapters implement this alongside ``GuardResponse`` by teeing their
    outgoing body stream: consume chunks from the underlying stream,
    buffering only up to ``max_bytes``, and return that prefix. The response
    object must still deliver its complete, unbounded body to the client
    afterward exactly as if this method had never been called -- typically
    by replacing the body iterator with one that first replays the captured
    prefix, then continues the original iterator untouched. It is a
    separate, optional protocol: an adapter that only implements
    ``GuardResponse`` is still fully valid, and callers must treat the
    absence of this capability as "cannot bound the read" and skip
    body-based pattern matching for that response entirely.

    STREAMING CONTRACT: implementations MUST NOT consume the underlying
    stream to completion to satisfy this call, and MUST NOT block waiting
    for more data than the stream is currently ready to produce. An
    indefinite stream (server-sent events, long polling) may never produce
    ``max_bytes`` of data; a call that waits for it to do so stalls the
    response indefinitely. Return whatever prefix is available from the
    chunks already produced when a natural stopping point is reached (for
    example, after the first chunk, or once ``max_bytes`` is reached,
    whichever comes first) rather than blocking for exactly ``max_bytes``.

    DETECTION LIMIT: only the returned prefix is ever scanned. A payload
    placed after the first ``max_bytes`` of the body, or a signature split
    across the ``max_bytes`` boundary, is not detected. This is the
    memory/detection tradeoff bounded-memory scanning makes on purpose; it
    is not equivalent to scanning the full body and must not be presented
    as such.

    MEMORY OBLIGATION (mirrors ``BoundedBodyReader`` /
    GHSA-xv6g-49vj-7w9c): the caller defensively slices the returned bytes
    to ``max_bytes``, but that slice only trims what the implementation
    already returned; it cannot stop an implementation from reading or
    buffering more than ``max_bytes`` internally before returning, and it
    cannot force a streaming response to keep streaming to the client
    afterward. Implementations MUST NOT buffer more than ``max_bytes``
    while producing the prefix, and MUST leave the response able to
    deliver its full, unbounded body to the client exactly as if this
    method had never been called -- guard-core has no way to enforce
    either obligation from the caller side.
