    WHAT: the bridge between the engine and a collector (the SaaS via
    guard-agent): it buffers events/metrics and pulls dynamic rules back.
    WHEN: the middleware calls ``send_event``/``send_metric`` per request when
    an agent is configured; ``start``/``stop`` bound its background lifecycle.
    HOW: implement non-blocking, fire-and-forget sends (buffer and flush rather
    than block the request); never let a transport error reach the caller.
