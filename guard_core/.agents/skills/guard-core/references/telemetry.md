# Telemetry

guard-core emits security events and request metrics through a composable, two-tier pipeline. Mute works globally inside `CompositeAgentHandler.send_event` / `.send_metric`; every emission site (event bus, decorator-level, handler-level) routes through the composite when the adapter wires it via `HandlerInitializer.initialize_agent_integrations()`.

## Two tiers

| Tier | Gate | Exporters see |
|---|---|---|
| Raw | `enable_otel=True` and/or `enable_logfire=True` | All event types, all metrics, W3C `traceparent`/`tracestate` continuation, muting. No `guard.*` enrichment. |
| Enriched | `enable_agent=True` + `enable_enrichment=True` | Raw plus `guard.project_id`, `guard.service.name`, `guard.deployment.environment`, `guard.threat_score`, `guard.rule.id` + `guard.rule.version`, `guard.behavior.correlation_key` + `guard.behavior.recent_event_count`. |

`enable_enrichment=True` without `enable_agent=True` raises `ValidationError`. Enrichment is always client-side; guard-core-app's backend stores the fields as-is, no server-side computation.

## Config surface (10 fields)

| Field | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `muted_event_types` | `set()` | Suppress these event types from every exporter. |
| `muted_metric_types` | `set()` | Suppress these metric types. |
| `muted_check_logs` | `set()` | Suppress in-check `log_activity()` output. |
| `enable_otel` | `False` | OpenTelemetry export (requires `[otel]` extra). |
| `otel_service_name` | `"guard-core"` | OTel resource service name. |
| `otel_exporter_endpoint` | `None` | OTLP/HTTP endpoint; `None` uses OTel default `localhost:4318`. |
| `otel_resource_attributes` | `{}` | Extra OTel resource attributes. A `service.name` key here overrides `otel_service_name`. |
| `enable_logfire` | `False` | Logfire export (requires `[logfire]` extra). |
| `logfire_service_name` | `"guard-core"` | Logfire service name. |
| `enable_enrichment` | `False` | Populate `guard.*` metadata. Requires `enable_agent=True`. |

## OTel instruments

`send_metric` emits: `guard.request.duration` (histogram, seconds), `guard.request.count` (counter), `guard.error.count` (counter). Any other metric type produces a one-line warning and is dropped.

## Logfire + Pydantic: the deferred mute (postmortem)

A host app calling `logfire.instrument_pydantic()` instruments every Pydantic model validation. guard-core's telemetry models live in the `guard-agent` package (`SecurityEvent`, `SecurityMetric`, `EventBatch`). `SecurityEvent` is validated per request, and `EventBatch` re-validates every buffered event on each flush, so an instrumented host would otherwise emit one span per security-event validation — hundreds of thousands a day under real traffic (a real production postmortem measured ~384k spans/day of pure guard-event validation noise).

guard-core prevents this the first time it actually starts using guard-agent's telemetry models, not at `import guard_core`. Importing `guard_agent.models` pulls in `guard_agent.client`, `guard_agent.transport`, `guard_agent.encryption`, and `cryptography`; running the mute unconditionally at import cost every process roughly 250ms even when `enable_agent`, `enable_otel`, and `enable_logfire` were all off.

This is backed by three complementary checks -- two static/import-time checks in `tests/test_telemetry_model_access.py`, plus a session-outcome assertion in `tests/conftest.py` -- not by auditing (or by proving) every construction site by hand. Every construction site, including per-request paths in the event bus, the decorators, the detection engine, rate limiting, IP banning, dynamic rules, behavior tracking, Redis, cloud-provider blocking, geo-IP, and security headers, calls `guard_core._pydantic_plugin_mute.get_telemetry_model(name)`, which runs the mute and only then returns the class, rather than importing `guard_agent` directly.

The first check is an AST scan: it walks every file in `guard_core/` (the sync tree is generated from it, so it is the one source of truth) and fails the build if any module outside a two-file allowlist (`_pydantic_plugin_mute.py` itself, and `models.py` for `AgentConfig` alone, which is not a telemetry model) uses one of the ways anyone has actually reached `guard_agent`: a plain import, an aliased import, a submodule import followed by attribute access, or the `importlib.import_module`/`__import__` indirection builtins. A `TYPE_CHECKING`-only reference is exempted since it never runs. **This half is a lint on known shapes, not a proof**: a dynamically constructed module name (built from string concatenation, a variable, or anything else a static scan cannot resolve to a literal) would not be caught, and it only sees source that exists on disk, not source a given test run actually executes.

The second check is `_GuardAgentImportFinder`, a `sys.meta_path` finder that `tests/conftest.py` installs for the whole test session (`pytest_configure`) and tears down at the end (`pytest_sessionfinish`). It records the calling module for every `guard_agent` import the interpreter's own import machinery actually resolves, and the session fails if any caller outside the same two-module allowlist ever triggered one. **This is narrower than it sounds**: `sys.meta_path` finders are consulted only on a `sys.modules` cache miss, and the allowlisted mute module is normally the first thing in a session to import `guard_agent` legitimately, so the finder in practice only ever gets a chance to catch the *first* importer of `guard_agent` in a session. Every import after that first one -- static or dynamic, `importlib.import_module`, `__import__`, whatever shape -- is served straight from the cache and never reaches any `sys.meta_path` finder at all, including this one. Pairing it with the suite's 100% line and branch coverage does not close that gap: coverage says every line ran, not that every `guard_agent` import went through a cache miss.

The third check is the one that actually speaks to the property users depend on. What matters is not "only the mute module ever imports `guard_agent`" but **"if `guard_agent` was imported at all, the telemetry models ended up muted"** -- a property that does not care how the import happened. A `pytest_sessionfinish` assertion in `tests/conftest.py`, backed by `_unmuted_guard_agent_telemetry_models()`, checks exactly that: only if `guard_agent` is present in `sys.modules` at session end, it requires `SecurityEvent`, `SecurityMetric`, and `EventBatch` to each carry `plugin_settings == {"logfire": {"record": "off"}}`. It reads the three models straight out of `sys.modules` instead of importing them, so the check itself can never be the thing that first triggers the import it is testing for, and it does not false-positive on a run where `guard_agent` is never imported at all. Because it asserts an outcome rather than an import mechanism, it is indifferent to whether the import was cached or not, static or dynamic, or ran before or after the finder was installed -- exactly the gap the first two checks cannot close. It is still a statement about this run only: with the suite at 100% line and branch coverage that is strong evidence that every code path guard-core's own tests exercise ends up muted, not a universal guarantee, and it says nothing about a `guard_agent` import that never happens during the run at all. The AST scan and the import finder stay in place as defence in depth -- the AST scan catches an unexercised bypass before it ever runs, and the finder still names a first-time offender when one shows up -- but the session-outcome assertion is the one whose pass or fail actually tracks what a user depends on.

`guard_core._pydantic_plugin_mute._mute_pydantic_plugin_instrumentation()` is the idempotent primitive underneath — the first call in a process does the work, every later call is a no-op. `get_telemetry_model()` calls it before every model access. `SecurityConfig.to_agent_config()` (the `enable_agent=True` path) and `HandlerInitializer.initialize_agent_integrations()` (the `enable_otel`/`enable_logfire`/`enable_enrichment` path, which can build a telemetry-capable `CompositeAgentHandler` with no agent at all) also call it directly, since they are the two points a configuration first needs `guard_agent` to exist at all, ahead of any model construction. The mute itself imports the three guard-agent models, sets `model.model_config["plugin_settings"]["logfire"] = {"record": "off"}` on each, and calls `model.model_rebuild(force=True)` (plugin_settings is only read while building a validator, so the rebuild is required). It is wrapped in try/except and silently no-ops if `guard_agent` is not installed or the mutation fails (with a warning log).

Verified behavior on the installed package:

* After `import guard_core` alone: `SecurityEvent.model_config.get("plugin_settings")` is still `None`, and `guard_agent` is not in `sys.modules`.
* After a configuration that actually turns on `enable_agent`, `enable_otel`, or `enable_logfire` initializes: it is `{'logfire': {'record': 'off'}}` for all three models.

Implication for consumers: you do not need to add `plugin_settings` to anything, as long as guard-core's own `SecurityConfig` is what turns telemetry on — you do not need to import guard-core ahead of time for this to work, since the mute rides along with the configuration that first needs it. The guard-core models themselves (`SecurityConfig` etc.) do not carry `plugin_settings`; only the guard-agent telemetry models do, and guard-core mutates them on your behalf once telemetry is configured. **Caveat:** of the three checks, only the session-outcome assertion covers a dynamically constructed module name, `importlib.import_module`, and `__import__` alike, and it does so by not caring how `guard_agent` got into `sys.modules` in the first place, only whether the three models ended up muted once it did. The AST scan and the import finder are narrower and exist as defence in depth on top of it: the AST scan only sees known import shapes in source on disk at edit time, and the import finder only ever gets a chance to see the first import of `guard_agent` a session performs. None of the three checks covers a host application (or another library) that constructs `SecurityEvent`/`SecurityMetric`/`EventBatch` through a path that never goes through a guard-core `SecurityConfig` — calling `guard_agent` directly without ever enabling `enable_agent`/`enable_otel`/`enable_logfire` on a guard-core config, for instance — that construction is outside guard-core's own code entirely, so none of the checks observes it; call the mute yourself or set `plugin_settings` on those three models directly.
