# Detection Engine

`guard_core.detection_engine` exposes four components, orchestrated by `SusPatternsManager` (`guard_core/handlers/suspatterns_handler.py`).

## Public entry point

```python
from guard_core.handlers.suspatterns_handler import SusPatternsManager

result = await SusPatternsManager().detect(
    content=user_input,
    ip_address=request.client_host or "unknown",
    context="query_param",  # one of the context zones
    correlation_id=None,
    enabled_categories=None,  # subset of the 19, None = all
)
```

`context` filters which categories run. Valid zones: `query_param`, `header`, `url_path`, `request_body`, `unknown`. Each category maps to a frozenset of zones via `CATEGORY_CONTEXT_MAP`; a category runs only when its zones include the supplied context. `unknown` is the catch-all.

## detect() return shape

`dict[str, Any]` with at least: `is_threat: bool`, `threat_score`, `threats` (list of regex + semantic threat dicts), `regex_threats`, `semantic_threats`, `matched_patterns`, `timeouts`, `execution_time_ms`, `detection_method` (`"enhanced"` when a `PatternCompiler` is wired, else `"legacy"`).

For a boolean + pattern-name result, use `detect_pattern_match(content, ip_address, context, correlation_id) -> tuple[bool, str | None]`.

## DetectionResult

`guard_core.detection_result.DetectionResult` is a lightweight dataclass:

```python
@dataclass
class DetectionResult:
    is_threat: bool
    trigger_info: str
    threat_categories: list[str] = field(default_factory=list)
    threat_scores: dict[str, float] = field(default_factory=dict)
```

## The 19 categories

`ALL_DETECTION_CATEGORIES` (`guard_core/handlers/suspatterns_handler.py`): `xss`, `sqli`, `dir_traversal`, `path_traversal`, `cmd_injection`, `file_inclusion`, `ldap`, `xml`, `ssrf`, `nosql`, `file_upload`, `template`, `http_split`, `sensitive_file`, `cms_probing`, `recon`, `proto_pollution`, `code_injection`, `deserialization`.

`deserialization` (CWE-502) matches Java (`rO0AB`), .NET `BinaryFormatter` (`AAEAAAD`) and Ruby `Marshal` (`BAh[Jv7bV]`) serialized payloads in their base64 wire form (`_DESERIALIZATION_JAVA_B64_RE`, `_DESERIALIZATION_DOTNET_B64_RE`, `_DESERIALIZATION_RUBY_B64_RE`, `guard_core/handlers/suspatterns_handler.py:291-294`), the raw XAML gadget marker `<ObjectDataProvider` (`guard_core/handlers/suspatterns_handler.py:2410`), and PHP (`O:`/`C:`/`E:`). Python pickle is matched two ways: the base64 marker `gASV`/`gAWV` (`_DESERIALIZATION_PICKLE_B64_RE`, `guard_core/handlers/suspatterns_handler.py:293`), and the raw (non-base64) protocol-0 `GLOBAL` opcode text itself, `c<module>\n<name>\n` (`_DESERIALIZATION_PICKLE_OS_GLOBAL_RE`, `_DESERIALIZATION_PICKLE_GLOBAL_GENERIC_RE`, `guard_core/handlers/suspatterns_handler.py:295-301`, wired into the category's pattern list at `:2394-2405`). Raw bytes are reachable: the request body is decoded with `body_bytes.decode("utf-8", errors="surrogateescape")` (`guard_core/_utils/penetration_detection.py:102`), which never rejects a byte, so non-UTF-8 pickle opcode bytes reach the patterns unchanged. `tests/test_sus_patterns/test_pickle_global_opcode_prefix_bypass.py` proves raw and binary-prefixed pickle payloads are detected through the real `detect_penetration_attempt` entry point across the request body, form body, multipart body, query parameter, and JSON body shapes.

`ssrf` also matches the IPv4-mapped IPv6 loopback bracket form (`http://[::ffff:127.0.0.1]/`) and a trailing-dot `localhost` (`http://localhost./`), alongside its existing dotted-quad, `localhost`, private/link-local-range, and cloud-metadata-alias coverage; `http://[::ffff:8.8.8.8]/` (a public address in the same bracket shape) stays unflagged.

## Request-value scan cap

`SecurityConfig.detection_max_scan_values` (default `512`, `ge=2`) bounds the total number of individual values -- query parameters, header values, JSON keys and leaf values, form fields, multipart parts, including JSON embedded within a single value -- scanned per request across the whole penetration-detection pass (`guard_core/_security_config_fields.py`). The budget is a per-request `contextvars.ContextVar` pair (`guard_core/_utils/detection_scan.py`), reset around each `detect_penetration_attempt` call. Each named value costs two scan units, one for its name and one for its value, so the minimum is `2`, not `1`. Once the cap is reached, remaining values in that request are not scanned, and a one-time `logger.warning` (per request) names the client IP, so the fail-open stays visible instead of silent.

Request parameter/field/key **names**, not only values, are scanned for injection patterns (`_scan_component_name` in `guard_core/_utils/detection_scan.py`, called from `_scan_query_params`, `_scan_headers`, `_scan_json_value`, `_scan_form_body`, and `_scan_multipart_body` in `guard_core/_utils/body_content_scan.py`): `?username[$ne]=admin`, `?__proto__[isAdmin]=true`, a JSON body key `"1;DROP TABLE x"`, or a multipart field named `__proto__[x]` are all detected via the name, even when the value itself is benign. An excluded header's name and value still get the Log4Shell JNDI shield (`ALWAYS_SCAN_HEADER_PATTERNS`, `guard_core/handlers/suspatterns_handler.py`, checked by `_scan_excluded_header_component` in `guard_core/_utils/body_content_scan.py`) rather than the full pipeline, preserving the excluded-header design.

Each has a default weight of `1.0` in `DETECTION_CATEGORY_WEIGHTS`; specific regex patterns override via `DETECTION_PATTERN_WEIGHT_OVERRIDES` (e.g. a bare `SELECT ... FROM` is down-weighted to 0.5 to reduce false positives).

## Request-byte scan cap

`SecurityConfig.detection_max_scan_bytes` (default `65536`, `ge=1024`, `le=262144`) bounds the total characters, across every value handed to the pattern engine per request, at the same accounting point `detection_max_scan_values` uses (`_scan_byte_budget_exhausted` alongside `_scan_value_budget_exhausted`, `guard_core/_utils/detection_scan.py`). `detection_max_scan_values` bounds the *count* of scanned values; a handful of individually large values can cost as much CPU as many small ones without ever approaching that count, which is what this cap closes (GHSA-3hfx-8m47-5f9h residual: 28 values x 9342 characters cost 1.81s CPU in enhanced mode with no cap). The budget is a leaky-bucket, not a hard per-value truncation: a value already in progress when checked (the running total from *prior* values is still under the cap) is always scanned in full, even if that pushes the total over the cap, so a single large legitimate value (a big JSON body scanned as one blob, for example) is never silently skipped outright; only values that would *start* after the budget is already spent are skipped. Once that happens, a one-time `logger.warning` per request names the cap and the client IP, the same signal `detection_max_scan_values` gives.

`detect_penetration_attempt(request, config)` configures the detection singleton from `config` when it is unconfigured (`state.compiler is None`) or was last configured from a different config object (identity compared, `guard_core/_utils/penetration_detection.py::_ensure_detection_singleton_configured`), instead of requiring the caller to call `sus_patterns_handler.configure(config)` itself first. This is idempotent and cheap on the hot path (an identity check, not a rebuild) once the singleton is already configured from the same object. Before this, a direct caller of `detect_penetration_attempt` that never explicitly configured the singleton (guard-core-mcp's `check_payload`, a PoC script, a test) ran the legacy path: `_check_regex_pattern` dispatches every pattern through `shared_regex_executor().submit(...)` plus `future.result(timeout=...)`, about 8300 cross-thread round trips for the 28x9342 body, 14 to 19s CPU instead of the enhanced path's 1.81s -- an order of magnitude slower, with different detection results on some payloads.

`detection_max_body_inspect_bytes` no longer skips a body whose declared `Content-Length` exceeds the cap: `_read_capped_body` (`guard_core/_utils/body_reader.py`) still reads and scans the first `detection_max_body_inspect_bytes` bytes (a one-time warning names the cap and the client), so an attack in the first kilobyte of an oversized body is still detected instead of the whole request silently bypassing detection.

Three constant-factor cuts reduce the per-byte cost of the enhanced path itself, each proven result-identical (same recall, same false-positive count) by the two-sided detection-gate corpus and benchmark before and after. First: `PerformanceMonitor.record_metric` (`guard_core/detection_engine/monitor.py`) computed `stats.avg_execution_time` with `statistics.mean`, which does exact `Fraction` arithmetic; called once per pattern check (about 8600 times for the 28x9342-character shape above), this accounted for roughly 30% of enhanced-mode CPU for a request that large. It now uses `math.fsum(stats.recent_times) / len(stats.recent_times)`, the same approach `monitor_anomalies.py` already used elsewhere.

Second: `SemanticAnalyzer.analyze` (`guard_core/detection_engine/semantic.py`) called `extract_tokens` twice on the same content, once inside `analyze_attack_probability` and once for `token_count`; it now extracts tokens once per `analyze` call and reuses them for both.

## JSON body depth cap

`SecurityConfig.detection_max_json_depth` (default `32`, `ge=1`, `le=1000`) bounds how deep the structural JSON-body walk descends (`guard_core/_security_config_fields.py`). The walk (`_scan_json_value` in `guard_core/_utils/body_content_scan.py`) is an explicit-stack iteration, not recursion: a dict or list reached at this depth is serialized back to text with `json.dumps(value, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False)` and scanned as one value through `_scan_body_field` under the same key label the structural walk would have used, so a payload hidden below the cap is still scanned as text, bounded by `detection_max_content_length`. A one-time `logger.warning` (per request, on the `guard_core` logger) names the client IP once the cap is reached, mirroring the scan-value cap's once-per-request mechanism (`_json_depth_cap`/`_json_depth_warned` contextvars in `guard_core/_utils/detection_scan.py`, reset alongside the scan-value budget by `_scan_value_budget`). Before this cap, the walk recursed one Python call per nesting level with no bound (GHSA-f6cf-jjhc-qp85, CWE-674): a deeply nested body raised `RecursionError` out of `detect_penetration_attempt`, and at depths just below the recursion limit the enhanced-detection exception fallback silently swallowed the error and scanned the request as clean instead of failing secure. `_check_value_enhanced` (`guard_core/_utils/detection_scan.py`) no longer treats `RecursionError` as a fallback case, it re-raises so the pipeline's fail-secure handling sees it; every other exception still falls back to the bounded regex scan.

`_try_check_json_value` (same file) is a separate check: it looks for a JSON object embedded inside a single query parameter, header, or form-field value, not the request body. It only caught `json.JSONDecodeError` around its own `json.loads(value)` call, so a value holding around 1000 nested braces raised `RecursionError` before that fallback ever ran (same CWE-674 class as the body-walk issue above, different code path). It now also catches `RecursionError`, treats the value as not-embedded-JSON, and fires the same `detection_max_json_depth` warning; the outer pattern scan of the raw value still runs.

## Preprocessing layers

`ContentPreprocessor.preprocess(content)` applies up to 7 decode/normalize layers before matching: Unicode normalization, URL-decode, HTML-entity decode, null-byte removal, whitespace normalization, attack-region-aware truncation to `detection_max_content_length`, plus opportunistic base64 / hex / Unicode-escape / SQL-comment stripping. Match against the preprocessed content, never raw.

## Semantic analysis

`SemanticAnalyzer.analyze(content)` returns a dict with `attack_probability` (per-category 0-1), `obfuscation` (bool), `code_injection_risk` (float), `threat_score`. Scoring is deterministic: keyword-overlap, Shannon entropy, encoding-layer count, obfuscation indicators. It is not machine learning and does not learn from traffic.

## ReDoS safety

`PatternCompiler.validate_pattern_safety(pattern, test_strings=None, max_content_length=None)` (`guard_core/detection_engine/compiler.py`) first rejects a pattern that hits a known-dangerous construct (`(.*)+`, `(.+)+`, nested quantifiers -- `_dangerous_construct_violation`) and one that fails to compile. Past that, it runs in one of two modes:

* With `test_strings` (the `add_pattern`/dynamic-rule/content-filter call sites): a broader structural pre-filter (`_first_structural_safety_violation`, flagging adjacent broad unbounded quantifiers, ambiguous optional tails in quantified groups, unreachable terminator scans, and ambiguous literal boundaries), then a timed probe of the pattern against `test_strings` inside a **killable subprocess** (`subprocess.run(..., timeout=2.0)`, never a thread the caller waits on), rejecting if any probe exceeds a 50ms-per-string budget.
* Without `test_strings` (the default, used to probe a pattern at a caller's real content-length cap): a timed cost arbiter (`_reach_probe_cost_verdict`) builds adversarial probes at four sizes (roughly 4k/8k/16k/32k characters), times each with `time.process_time()` in a killable subprocess (minimum of 5 samples, median drives the verdict), and rejects only if the growth-extrapolated cost at `max_content_length` exceeds 50ms; a structural hit supplies the rejection reason when the arbiter also rejects, but a structural hit measured under budget and linear does not reject on its own, and no probe being buildable forces fail-closed rejection.

This validation subprocess mechanism is unrelated to, and isolated from, the live-scan pool: built-in (compile-time-vetted, never run through `validate_pattern_safety` at runtime) patterns match directly via `pattern.search()` with no per-match timeout; only custom patterns added via `SusPatternsManager.add_pattern(pattern, custom=True)` run through the shared thread-pool safe-matcher (`shared_regex_executor()`, `guard_core/detection_engine/compiler.py`) with a timeout at match time. Four consecutive timeouts recycle the shared pool (stale workers shut down non-blocking) so one pathological pattern cannot wedge every worker. Separately, the enhanced-detection exception fallback (`_fallback_pattern_check`, `guard_core/_utils/detection_scan.py`) routes every pattern through the same bounded matchers the enhanced scan uses (`SusPatternsManager._check_regex_pattern`), so a pattern-level exception on the enhanced path no longer falls through to an unbounded `pattern.search()`.

## Scan-window bounded matchers

`guard_core.detection_engine.scan_window` (`bounded_search`, `bounded_finditer`) bounds the regex *scan window*, not the match length, for built-in patterns shaped `literal_prefix + unbounded_negated_class + terminator`. It locates every prefix and terminator occurrence with two linear `finditer` passes, then runs the pattern's own unmodified, uncapped regex only against the bounded span from each prefix candidate to the farthest reachable terminator, so neither an unbounded quantifier nor a `{0,N}` length cap is needed to stay linear, and outcome (matched or not) agrees with running the pattern unbounded. `_WINDOWED_PATTERN_FINDERS` (`guard_core/handlers/suspatterns_handler.py`) maps specific built-in pattern strings to a `prefix`/`terminator` pair wired through `bounded_finditer`; a pattern not in that mapping matches directly, uncapped.

## Tuning knobs (SecurityConfig)

`detection_max_content_length` (default 10000), `detection_compiler_timeout` (default 2.0s, range 0.1-10.0), `detection_threat_score_threshold` (default 1.0), `detection_max_scan_values` (default 512, `ge=2`; see [Request-value scan cap](#request-value-scan-cap) above), `enabled_detection_categories` (`frozenset[str]`, subset of the 19, defaults to all 19). `PatternCompiler.validate_pattern_safety`'s 50ms cost-arbiter budget is a hardcoded constant, not a config field; only `max_content_length` (the caller's real content-length cap) is passed in per call.

## Adding patterns

```python
ok = await SusPatternsManager.add_pattern(r"<script.*?>", custom=True)
```

Custom patterns are ReDoS-validated, compiled with `re.IGNORECASE | re.MULTILINE`, and (when Redis is enabled) persisted under the `patterns` key. `remove_pattern(pattern, custom=False)` removes them. Do not add unvetted patterns as built-in; custom patterns get the timeout safety path.
