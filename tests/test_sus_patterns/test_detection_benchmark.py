    "a field whose entire value is an absolute-path or env-prefixed shell "
    "invocation spec, the Docker/K8s command or entrypoint override shape, "
    "is character-identical to the attack shape the widened cmd_injection "

    "character-identical to that param=scheme://host/path.ext RFI payload "

    "backdoor.txt-shaped payload this pattern was built to catch depends "
    "on the fetched content containing script tags, not on the extension "
    "or path depth; an app that legitimately serves such download links "
    "needs route-level allowlisting, not a narrower pattern that would "
    "lose recall on file_inclusion_rfi_https_domain_backdoor_txt. The "
    ".sh/.cgi target extensions were dropped from the alternation instead: "
    "0 malicious corpus entries depend on either (measured), so "

_SSTI_HASH_BRACE_CALL_SYNTAX_KNOWN_FP_REASON = (

    "function-call shape (a word immediately followed by parentheses) "
    "appearing anywhere inside the braces; a genuine method call on a "
    "string or object (helper.format(value)) is character-identical to "
    "that call-branch SSTI shape and cannot be told apart by structure "
    "alone. Narrowing the call-branch to empty-parens-only (as the "
    "sibling {{ }} gate now does) was tried and reverted: it lost recall "
    "on two real corpus dependents that pass non-empty arguments to the "
    "flagged call (template_ssti_hash_brace_java_runtime_exec's "
    "T(java.lang.Runtime).exec('id'), and the embedded-terminator regression "
    'corpus\'s #{"a#b".gsub(/x/,"y")}); an app that legitimately accepts '

_SSRF_BARE_PRIVATE_IP_NO_URL_CONTEXT_KNOWN_FP_REASON = (

    "param, header, or JSON body field value, with no surrounding URL "
    "context (no scheme, no path segment after it, no port), is "
    "character-identical to the same bare IP planted as a raw SSRF probe "
    "value in that same field; test_ssrf_corpus.py::KNOWN_GOOD_SSRF_TARGETS "
    "pins the identical bare shape ('10.0.0.5', '127.0.0.1', "
    "'192.168.1.1') as a required detection so a metadata/loopback/private "
    "IP dropped bare into any field is still caught, and cannot be told "
    "apart by structure alone from a legitimate internal upstream/host "
    "value. An application that legitimately carries bare internal IPs in "
    "a named field should exclude that field via "
